## Welcome To YouTinul (WIP!!!)

Download youtube video with the highest quality available using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.

# Why create this project?
currently, if you try to donwload youtube video, there will be certain limit of available video + audio quality. Higher than that, you will only get video only without audio. Therefore this simple side project will just do that (download the highest quality avaialble separately then combine them (video + audio) together into one .mp4 file).  

As for (26/8/2024), the core code (barebone .py code) can be used  but lacking GUI. Therefore right now, I am making the GUI support (My first time doing GUI so bare in mind lol). Okay so after trying bunch of library and tools (even want to try Rust (Ratatui)), I end up choosing Tkinter (super basic) but with CustomTkinter support to make it beautiful.
